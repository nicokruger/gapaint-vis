This project is a visualisation experiment for the GA-generated images from the gapaint project (http://github.com/jacovanniekerk/gapaint).

To check it it out, go to http://inmytree.co.za/gapaint-vis.

The polygons from that project are dumped using the JSON dumper, and can then be animated by this tool. Thus, it also serves as a playground for the gamescreen lib.

Running
-------
The simplest way is to use python,

python < 3

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

python 3

    python -m http.server

Then simply go to http://localhost:8000
